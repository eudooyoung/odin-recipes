      I’ve been testing and perfecting this
      <strong>authentic cacio e pepe</strong> recipe since I moved back from
      Italy, for almost 10 years. <br />
      This no-frills, one-pot pasta is inspired by a beloved neighborhood
      restaurant in Rome, one that Anthony Bourdain famously loved.<br />
      It uses just three ingredients (pasta, pecorino cheese, and black pepper)
      and is ready in 20 minutes flat. No butter, no cream, no fuss.<br />
      Just perfectly creamy, peppery pasta that’s as close to the real thing as
      you’ll get without booking a flight to Rome.

  <h2>Ingredient</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Pasta:</strong> Traditionally made with tonnarelli or bucatini.
      Spaghetti, linguine, and fettuccine work too— ideally, choose something
      long and sturdy to hold the sauce but other pasta shapes can work in a
      pinch too.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Pecorino Romano:</strong> Sharp, salty, and dry—ideal for melting
      into a creamy, emulsified sauce. Grate it fresh using the smallest hole.
      You can also use parmesan (parmigiano reggiano), but Pecorino gives it a
      distinct nutty, salty flavor.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Black pepper:</strong> I grind whole peppercorns and toast the
      freshly cracked pepper to release its oils. This rounds out the sharpness
      of the cheese. This isn’t a background ingredient—it’s half the flavor.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Bring a large pot of water to boil (with salt) to cook the pasta. While
      pasta cooks, grate Pecorino Romano cheese (using the smallest hole on your
      box grater or better, a microplane). Set aside in a large bowl.
    </li>
    <li>
      2 to 3 minutes before pasta is al dente, heat a large skillet on
      medium-high heat. Add a generous amount of freshly cracked pepper and
      toast it. Reserve a cup of the pasta water and allow it to cool down a
      bit.
    </li>
    <li>
      Grab a ladle more of pasta water and add into the pan with the pepper.
      Turn to a simmer. The water will bubble, and turn white due to the starch
      (this is good, because it’ll help the cheese and pepper bind to your
      pasta)./li>
    </li>
    <li>
      Add a quarter cup of the pasta water to a bowl with cheese, ideally one
      tablespoon at a time and whisk it together using a fork to create a thick
      paste. Add cautiously since you don’t want it to get runny (but don’t fret
      if it does, just add more cheese!)
    </li>
    <li>
      Remove the pasta and add it to the skillet with the pepper and water, and
      toss to coat using tongs. The starchy pasta water is critical for binding
      with the cheese to create a smooth sauce!
    </li>
    <li>
      Finally, turn the heat off, and add the cheesy paste to the skillet with
      the pasta. Toss evenly until combined and smooth (cheese should not be
      chunky).
    </li>
    <li>
      Serve hot with a grind of coarse black pepper and a sprinkle of cheese!
    </li>
