        Classic Spaghetti Aglio e Olio is easy to make with just 4 simple
        ingredients (spaghetti, olive oil, garlic and crushed red pepper
        flakes),<br />
        it comes together in 20 minutes, and it is always such a winner.

    <h2>Ingredient</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Spaghetti:</strong> Or linguine, fettuccine, or any other shape
        of pasta noodle you prefer.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Olive oil:</strong> Since olive oil is the main ingredient in
        this sauce, I really recommend using the best-quality extra virgin olive
        oil you can find. It will make a difference!
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Garlic:</strong> I admittedly like tons of garlic in this pasta
        (like, closer to 10-12 cloves). But it is traditionally made with
        between 4-8 cloves. So you do what sounds best to you!
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Crushed red pepper flakes:</strong> Traditional spaghetti aglio
        e olio is made with fresh peperoncini (red hot chile peppers) that are
        commonly found throughout Italy. But since they are harder to find in
        other countries, I have written this recipe using dried crushed red
        pepper flakes, which we will simmer in the olive oil to bring out their
        best flavor.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Optional garnishes:</strong> The two most popular toppings for
        this classic Italian dish are finely-minced fresh parsley and/or
        freshly-grated Parmesan. I love adding both, but they are totally
        optional.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Cook the spaghetti.</strong> Cook the spaghetti in a
        generously-salted pot of boiling water until it is just one minute shy
        of being al dente.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Sauté the garlic.</strong> Meanwhile, about 3 minutes after you
        add the pasta to the boiling water, heat the olive oil in a large sauté
        pan over medium heat. Add the sliced garlic and crushed red pepper
        flakes and sauté for 3 to 5 minutes, or until the garlic is lightly
        golden.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Toss the pasta in the sauce.</strong> Once the pasta is ready to
        go, use tongs to transfer the pasta immediately to the sauté pan, along
        with 1/2 cup of the hot starchy pasta water. Toss the pasta continuously
        until it is evenly coated in the garlic sauce. If the sauce looks a bit
        too dry, add in another 1/4 cup of the starchy pasta water.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Taste and season.</strong> Give the pasta a quick taste add an
        extra pinch of salt and/or crushed red pepper flakes if needed.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Serve.</strong> Serve immediately while it’s nice and hot,
        garnished with any toppings that sound good.
      </li>
    </ol>
